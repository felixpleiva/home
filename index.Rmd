# About me

I am from Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±, where I grew up as an artisanal fisherman, catching Southern hake and other delicious fish.\
I started this trade at the tender age of 12, spending my summer and winter school holidays at sea.\
Even now, those early days still bring a lump to my throat â€” a source of great pride and cherished memories.

After more than a decade in fishing, I followed my passion into academia.\
I spent four years as a research assistant before embarking on my PhD journey in 2017 at **Radboud University** in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.\
Following that, I took a postdoctoral position at the **Alfred Wegener Institute** in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

Today, Iâ€™m thrilled to be back at Radboud University, continuing my research as a postdoctoral fellow.

My research primarily focuses on *macrophysiology*, complemented by elements of experimental *ecophysiology*, though this plays a smaller role in my work nowadays. These approaches enable me to uncover how animals thrive and adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions, across space and time.
